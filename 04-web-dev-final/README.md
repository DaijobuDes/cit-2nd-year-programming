## PHP Database for Final Requirements in Web Development

A PHP site with SQL database using XAMPP. The idea I got is from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) where all filled-up forms are encoded to the computer and submitted to the local server. This is not a copy but only for education purposes.

### Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with PSA in any way of, in creating this project. This should not be deployed into the internet as this contain vulnerabilities and I have no plan to fix them. I am not responsible to any damage that the software has caused to the system.
